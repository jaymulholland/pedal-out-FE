# pedal-out-FE
welcome to PedalOut Front End!
PedalOut is a social app where users can add & chat to friends, post their own bike rides, and find local bike rides going on in their area.
The app is designed to be non-competitive and social, encouraging users to get out and bike more and take part in their local community.
PedalOut is built with off-road biking activities in mind, but its structure can be adapted to other disciplines e.g snow-sports, running, road cycling, and dog-walking.

PedalOut FE is built with React Native & Expo, intended for the Android & iOS Platform.

Set-up:

** make sure your working path is "/pedal-out-fe/pedalout" ! **

run npm i 
(installs dependencies)


run npx expo start
(hosts the app on local server)
Scan the QR Code with the Expo Go app (Android) or use iOS Simulator (iOS) to view & interact with the app.

Customizing:

PedalOut uses React Natives Tabs structure to display app content. These can be found in the /app/(tabs) folder.
Components are added to these tabs.
index.tsx is the Explore page- named index as this is the intended startup page.
